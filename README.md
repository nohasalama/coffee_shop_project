# Coffee Shop Full Stack

## Full Stack Nano - IAM Final Project

Udacity has decided to open a new digitally enabled cafe for students to order drinks, socialize, and study hard. But they need help setting up their menu experience.

This project is a full stack drink menu application. The application:

1) Displays graphics representing the ratios of ingredients in each drink.
2) Allows public users to view drink names and graphics.
3) Allows the shop baristas to see the recipe information.
4) Allows the shop managers to create new drinks and edit existing drinks.

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a Flask server with a pre-written SQLAlchemy module.

[View the README.md within ./backend for more details.](./backend/README.md)

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a complete Ionic frontend to consume the data from the Flask server. 

[View the README.md within ./frontend for more details.](./frontend/README.md)

## Authors

Noha Salama has implemented the API endpoints in `api.py` and the authorization in `auth.py`.
The rest of the project files, including the frontend,were created by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) as a project base code for project 3 for the [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0044).
